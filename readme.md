This script is used to query `whois` information for a batch of domains.

To run this script,

```bash
# to check any available domain with `???.cc` pattern
python query.py --domain-name ???.cc
```

Make sure `whois` is installed,

```bash
sudo apt install whois
```

## TODO

- [ ] add `start-from` option
